        <h2>Why CrabLang?</h2>
          <p>
            The <a href="https://github.com/crablang/crab">Crab</a> (or “CrabLang”) community
            fork was created as a lighthearted yet measured response to the growing concerns
            within the community about the influence of corporations and the restrictive
            trademark policy proposed by the foundation. This was not a "knee-jerk" reaction,
            nor was it an attempt to spread fear or cause panic. While the document the
            foundation drafted <em>did</em> lead to the fork, we believe it is an overdue
            solution to a problem that already existed, and addresses some issues that
            many community members have had for some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            First and foremost: CrabLang is not trying to replace our beloved
            language. If you are happy with the way things are, we encourage you to
            continue using your language of choice. Our goal is not to fracture the
            community, but rather to provide an alternative for those who share our
            concerns and wish to have more freedom in using, creating with, and
            promoting the language without worrying about the litigation associated
            with trademark infringement.
          </p>
          <p>
            We acknowledge and appreciate the hard work and financial support that
            corporations have provided to the original project. We understand the
            importance of their contributions, but we also believe that it is
            essential to maintain a balance between corporate influence and the will
            of the community. The CrabLang Collective aims to provide a space where
            the community can thrive without the constraints imposed by corporate
            interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to emphasize that we are not at odds with the project working on
            the original language. We appreciate everything they do to make the
            language better, and our fork's main brach will continue to stay up to
            date with the upstream codebase. Our main goal is to ensure that the
            community has an alternative that aligns with their values and desire
            for unrestricted use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Crab community fork is driven by our love for a language named after
            a type of fungus. We simply want to use it while retaining the ability
            to create content and promote its name, logo, and other assets however
            we please, without the limitations imposed by a trademark policy. By
            offering a community-driven alternative, we hope to maintain a spirit of
            collaboration, innovation, and creative freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            With our shared passion for programming, we welcome anyone interested to
            join us in exploring the Crab community fork. Whether or not you fully
            agree with our concerns, we believe that diversity of thought and a
            commitment to inclusivity will only strengthen our collective efforts.
